The Malaria Cell Classification project aims to develop a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to accurately classify images of cells infected with malaria parasites and uninfected cells.
The dataset used for training and testing the CNN model consists of thousands of images of malaria-infected and uninfected cells. Each image is labeled with its corresponding class (infected or uninfected), allowing supervised learning.
The primary objective was to develop a CNN model capable of accurately classifying malaria-infected and uninfected cells and to evaluate the performance of the model on a test dataset and measure its accuracy.
